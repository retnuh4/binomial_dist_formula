# binomial_dist_formula
a python code I wrote to help me with homework so that I didn't have to write it all out by hand.
this code is much more objec oriented than the last one I wrote. I still am having problems
with the __init__ method if anybody wants to shed any light on that issue! If you are introductory stats
 and want to use this code go ahead, just download and run in your IDE or terminal/ command line
